            <h3>Why You Should Join</h3>
            <ul class="default">
                <li><b>Work on an Actual Satellite Project</b>: Yes, you read it right. Your code might just be orbiting
                    Earth someday!
                </li>
                <li><b>Become a PoliSpace Member</b>: PoliSpace is not just about the work. It's a community where
                    innovation, teamwork, and the excitement of space exploration converge.
                </li>
                <li><b>Flexible Learning Curve</b>: Whether you're a seasoned pro or a curious beginner in Software
                    Engineering, there's room for you.

            <ul class="default">
                <li>Gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge space and satellite technology.</li>
                <li>Work with proprietary SDKs and specialized software that you won't find in your typical web or
                    mobile apps.
                </li>
                <li>Dive deep into collaborative projects that require seamless interaction between software and

            <h3>Job Description & Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>As a Junior Software Engineer at PoliSpace, you'll focus on the more generalized software layers of our
                satellite project while learning the art of software engineering. You will focus on the more high-level design and development, with only few
                unattended dives into low level tasks.</p>
            <ul class="default">
                <li>Design, develop, and test generalized software components.</li>
                <li>Work with other team members to integrate your software with the rest of the codebase.</li>
                <li>Work with other subsystems and engineers from other engineering disciplines to design the software
                    to perform the required tasks.
                </li>
                <li>Write clear and useful documentations about the code you wrote</li>
                <li>Support your teammates with their tasks</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Can You Join?</h3>
            <p>You must be a student enrolled at Politecnico di Milano, pursuing a bachelor's, master's, or Ph.D.
                Alternatively, you could be an exchange/double-degree student with at least one year of study at
                Politecnico di Milano ahead.</p>
            <p>Both experienced coders and freshers are welcome. No prior space experience is required; we all started
                as terrestrial beings! New recruits will undergo a training phase, easing you into the project via
                detailed documentation and meetings. If you feel to be too advanced for this position, take a look at our <a href="sw_eng.html">(more senior) Software Engineer Position</a></p>

            <h3>What are we looking for?</h3>
            <ul class="default">
                <li><b>English Proficiency</b>: The application process, work meetings and all communications will be in
                    English. So, a strong grasp of the English language is vital.
                </li>
                <li><b>Previous experiences/projects</b>: For this Junior position, previous experience is not required.

            <h3>Time Requirements & Commitment</h3>
            <p>Joining PoliSpace is more than just an exciting academic endeavor; itâ€™s a serious commitment to advancing
                the field of space technology and contributing to a mission with real-world applications.</p>
            <ul class="default">
                <li><b>Duration</b>: Given the specialized nature and long-term goals of our satellite project, we
                    require a minimum commitment of 6 months. This ensures continuity and successful mission outcomes.
                </li>
                <li><b>Workload</b>: On average, team members are expected to dedicate approximately 6 hours every week.
                    Occasionally, you might need to put in a 10-hour week, but on the flip side, some weeks will be
                    lighter. There are usually two meetings each week, which are part of the 6-hour commitment.
