            <h3>Time Requirements & Commitment</h3>
            <p>Joining PoliSpace is more than just an exciting academic endeavor; it’s a serious commitment to advancing
                the field of space technology and contributing to a mission with real-world applications.</p>
            <ul class="default">
                <li><b>Duration</b>: Given the specialized nature and long-term goals of our satellite project, we
                    require a minimum commitment of 6 months. This ensures continuity and successful mission outcomes.
                </li>
                <li><b>Workload</b>: On average, team members are expected to dedicate approximately 6 hours.
                    Occasionally, you might need to put in a 10-hour week, but on the flip side, some weeks will be
                    lighter. There are usually two meetings each week, which are part of the 6-hour commitment.
